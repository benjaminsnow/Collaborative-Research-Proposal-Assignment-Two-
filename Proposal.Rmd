A research Proposal for the Collaborative Research Course

Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott

###Introduction




Looking at institutional setting to examine different types and levels of innovation…

Steps to undergo:

1.	 Taking available (15) countries and their innovation data

	Incremental vs radical innovation – we have a proxie variable for high tech innovation
or 
Some other variable which we use to reflect either the presence of innovation, or type of innovation (incremental vs. radical).


2.	Tag them into some sort of ‘CME vs LME’  (0 to 1 variable, or 1-4 with some threshold, or use each individual component)
(Soskice 2002?)
Industrial relations system  - find proxie
Education and training systems - find proxie
System governing intercompany relations - find proxie
System of company financing and corporate governance - find proxie

or

(Capser et al. p. 204) 
a.	Labour law. – find proxy variable
b.	Company law – find proxy variable
c.	Skill formation – strong vs weak. – find proxie
d.	Financial


Goal: Measure Innovation in 'CME vs LME' framekwork to examine effect of ‘variety of capitalism’ on innovation level and type.

Research Question:
**Does institutional framework (Coordinated vs Liberal Market Economy) effect Innovation Level and type**
