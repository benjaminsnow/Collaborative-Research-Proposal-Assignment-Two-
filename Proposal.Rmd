A research Proposal for the Collaborative Research Course

Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott

Introduction




Looking at institutional setting to examine different types and levels of innovation…

1.	 Taking 30-40 countries and their innovation data.
2.	Tag them into some sort of ‘CME vs LME’  (0 to 1 variable, or 1-4 with some threshold, or use each individual component)
(Soskice 2002?)
Industrial relations system  - find proxie
Education and training systems - find proxie
System governing intercompany relations - find proxie
System of company financing and corporate governance - find proxie

or

(Capser et al. p. 204) 
a.	Labour law. – find proxy variable
b.	Company law – find proxy variable
c.	Skill formation – strong vs weak. – find proxie
d.	Financial

3.	Incremental vs radical innovation – we have a proxie variable for high tech innovation

or 

Some other variable which we use to reflect either the presence of innovation, or type of innovation (incremental vs. radical).


Goal: Measure Innovation in 'CME vs LME' framekwork to examine effect of ‘variety of capitalism’ on innovation level and type.

Research Question:
Does institutional framework (Coordinated vs Liberal Market Economy) effect Innovation Level and type
