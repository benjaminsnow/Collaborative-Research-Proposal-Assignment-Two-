###Introduction




Looking at institutional setting to examine different types and levels of innovation…

Steps to undergo:

1.	 Taking available (15) countries and their innovation data

	Incremental vs radical innovation – we have a proxie variable for high tech innovation
or 
Some other variable which we use to reflect either the presence of innovation, or type of innovation (incremental vs. radical).


2.	Tag them into some sort of ‘CME vs LME’  (0 to 1 variable, or 1-4 with some threshold, or use each individual component)
(Soskice 2002?)
- Industrial relations system  - find proxie
- Education and training systems - find proxie
- System governing intercompany relations - find proxie
- System of company financing and corporate governance - find proxie

or

(Capser et al. p. 204) 
- Labour law. – find proxy variable
- Company law – find proxy variable
- Skill formation – strong vs weak. – find proxie
- Financial


Goal: Measure Innovation in 'CME vs LME' framekwork to examine effect of institutional setting on innovation level and type. 
We want to challenge the VoC framework and analyse to what extent the theory can in fact account for a country´s specialisation either in incremental or radical innovation.

Research Question:
**Does the institutional framework (Coordinated vs Liberal Market Economy) effect innovation level and type?**
