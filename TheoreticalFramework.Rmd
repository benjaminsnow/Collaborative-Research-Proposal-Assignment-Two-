### Open vs. closed access to knowledge: Using online network data to measure innovation
-----------------------

##Paragraphs

**Paragraph 1**

> What is innovation? Compare definitions, come up with our own general definition. Why is it important? Importance for economic growth, societal development, overcoming of challenges.

Students of public policy and economics have been interested in innovation for its significance for wealth creation and economic security. @taylor2004 views innovation as "the driving force behind modern economic growth, relative industrial power, and competitive advantage" (p.222). @schumpeter1942 greatly shaped the innovation discourse with his idea of structural change and the business cycle, the process that he termed "creative destruction". Using a rather broad view, @schumpeter1942 saw innovation as "a process of industrial mutation, that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one". On a more nuanced take, @smith2005 defined innovation as "the creation of something qualitatively new, via processes of learning and knowledge building. It involves changing competences and capabilities, and producing qualitatively new performance outcomes" [@smith2005, 149]. Although it has been accepted that innovation can take many forms, e.g. product, process, marketing and proccess innovations, @frankelius2009 in his extensive literature review of innovation studies criticized the widespread underlying assumption that innovation is limited to technological innovation.

**Paragraph 2**

> How is innovation measured? Range of indicators, input-throughput-output, difficult to measure. How do we compare innovation performance? Refer to rankings, race for innovation. At what level is it measured? Usually national but this has shortcomings, regional is more pronounced.

This technology focus can partly be explained by the difficulties associated with the measurement of innovation. @smith2005 notes the measuring challenge, as innovation is by definition a novelty and thus commensurability is a demanding task. For these reasons, innovation has traditionally though controversially been measured with a focus on inputs, such as personnel and equipment, as well as economic outputs in the form of patents, product output and related revenues [@freeman2009]. @smith2005 mentions the development of new indicators, but focuses on country level economic measures, which are helpful for comparability. @



**Paragraph 3**

> Why are patents important? Widely used and accepted as indicator. Comparison of closed/protected vs. open knowledge. Importance of networks for knowledge creation and sharing, complexity of current challenges, growing relevance of collaborations. New quality of networking enabled through new technology and software.

An indicator most often found in innovation research is patent data [see @taylor2004]. A patent is a "temporary legal monopoly granted by the government to an inventor for the commerical use of his or her invention [@taylor2004, 229). @taylor2004 goes on to describe the patent as a property right awarded when an invention is shown to be non-trivial, useful, and novel [@taylor2004, 230]. Patents were first used to measure demand-side determinants of innovation by Scherer and Schmookler [REFERENCE], and have been used in the analysis of innovation activity for over three decades [@taylor2004, 230). While long hindered by technological limitations requiring labor intensive patent analysis, recent improvements due to machine-readable patent data have spurred recent econometric analysis, as did for example @hall2005 who analyzed millions of patents. However, patents also have limitations.

@taylor2004 outlines several limitations to using patents to measure innovation. First, patents suffer from a 'classification problem' as assigning specific industries to patents, as industry of innovation and industry of production can change over time. Additionally, patents may vary widely in significance, both technically and economically [@taylor2004, 231]. Most significantly for the purpose on this study, Taylor describes that "not all inventions are patentable and not all patentable inventions are patented" [@taylor2004, 231]. Thus while previously patents have been considered to be the most effective proxy with which to measure innovation, even recent studies have begun to examine alternatives due to patents limitations in measuring innovation. As @freeman2009 noted, „characteristics that were important last century may well no longer be so relevant today and indeed may even be positively misleading“ (p.3). This is why for example @taylor2004 also used publication data as an innovation proxy.

However, both patents and academic publishing include only proprietary or closed forms of innovation, in the same manner that @taylor2004 finds that 'not all inventions are patentable', not all innovation needs to be an invention.  Taylor notes this point implicitly in searching for a way to weight the size of innovation from one published paper to the next. @taylor2004 uses reference (the number of times that a journal article is cited in other works) as a measure to weight the size of an innovation. 

Today we witness a shift away from the belief that innovation only occurs in professional R&D labs [@freeman2009, 12]. @freeman2009 even speaks of "research without frontiers" (p.13). In times, where networks and research collaborations become increasingly important, there have been relatively few studies focusing on network data [see for example @breschi2005].

Similarly, for this study we will be using the association of a contributor, but rather based around their reputation, and not their works citation level.  

**Paragraph 4**

> Exploration of relationship between patent and network data. (Currently networks are mainly analyzed by looking into paper citations, researchers' mobility). Innovation does not necessarily take place in firms, outcome not protected but accessible. Interesting questions: What is their relationship? What are the differences? Is there a potential lag between the two?

Since @freeman2009 among others called for the continuous improvement of innovation measurement, this work seeks to contribute to the refinement of innovation indicators. The purpose of this study is to explore the conceptual and statistical viability of a new metric by which we can measure innovation. New metrics are needed, because "too much energy has gone into squeezing the last bit of juice out of old data collected for different purposes relative to the design of new types of data" (Kenneth Arrow, quoted from Smith 2005, p. 148). 

## Research question
- Does the anlaysis of research networks function as an indicator to measure local level innovation performance?
- Is network analysis superior to patent analysis in order to measure innovation performance?
