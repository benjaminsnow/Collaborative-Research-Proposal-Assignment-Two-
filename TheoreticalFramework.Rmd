### Open vs. closed access to knowledge: Using online network data to measure innovation
-----------------------

##Paragraphs

**Paragraph 1**

What is innovation? Compare definitions, come up with our own general definition
Why is it important? Importance for economic growth, societal development, overcoming of challenges

**Paragraph 2**

How is innovation measured? Range of indicators, input-throughput-output, difficult to measure
How do we compare innovation performance? Refer to rankings, race for innovation
At what level is it measured? Usually national but this has shortcomings, regional is more pronounced

**Paragraph 3**

Why are patents important? Widely used and accepted as indicator
Comparison of closed/protected vs. open knowledge
Importance of networks for knowledge creation and sharing, complexity of current challenges, growing relevance of collaborations
New quality of networking enabled through new technology and software

**Paragraph 4**

Exploration of relationship between patent and network data
(Currently networks are mainly analyzed by looking into paper citations, researchers' mobility)
Interesting questions: What is their relationship? What are the differences? Is there a potential lag between the two?

## Research question
- Does the anlaysis of research networks function as an indicator to measure local level innovation performance?
- Is network analysis superior to patent analysis in order to measure innovation performance?
