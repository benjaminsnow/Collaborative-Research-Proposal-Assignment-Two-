## Assignment 2: Open vs. Closed Innovation
*Benjamin Snow and Oliver Bott*

### Background

This is the repository for the 'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis' course taught by @christophergandrud at the Hertie School of Governance.  This is the repository for Assignment 2, a proposal for a final research project.  

The assignment calls for: justifying why the topic of study is interesting, providing a basic literature review (properly cited using BibTeX), and identify data sources/methodologies that you can access to help answer your question. Next the task calls for clearly identifying and citing your intended data sources, and describing what format the data is currently in and how you intend to clean it up so that it is usable for statistical analysis. Lastly, given the data and research question, we are asked to answer what types of descriptive and inferential statistical are appropriate and feasible for you to answer your question (be as specific as possible including possibly looking up R functions and packages that implement these statistics.

The proposal can be found in the Proposal.Rmd file and is structured as follows:

1. Introduction 
2. State of the Field
3. Methodology
4. References 

The proposal includes dynamically linked academic references (see Main.bib) and citations for R packages (see Packages.bib).
